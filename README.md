- 👋 Hi, I’m @pulkownikw, a program analyst in government, where we are pretty far behind the times.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in improving the efficiency of government through the use of technology.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SharePoint, PowerApps, Qlik Sense... I have a background in Python 
- data development and web development, and I am hoping to find out how I can apply that skill set in the workplace.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on M365 PnP and development

- 📫 How to reach me: I'm not sure if there a contact card through GitHub yet, but since this is a work account, 
- I'd rather not beraodcast my official contact info just yet
